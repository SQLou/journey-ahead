# journey-ahead
I'm determined to become a developer. Why?  Well for similary reasons you want to.  I like science. I like technology. I like to create. I like to solve problems.  It is a career path I can embark and be satisfied with my life.  So I'm going to do it.  The career fields that interest me in ascending order are virtual learning websites like Schoology.com, mobile applications like Spotify, Cybersecurity, and Artificial Intelligence.  If I were to become and expert developer I would like to help write firmware or APIs for developing secure networks or working with A.I.  To be honest, this all sounds good, but I'm worried because I don't know where to start.  Most importantly, I don't know which tools to collect to begin my journey.  My experience with programming has been limited to Java.  It's a great language for learning programming fundamentals and good habits in my opinion, but the resource I have, a text book, hardly allows me to work in a practical environment or in a setting that will resemble any programmming related field.

I've gathered some new resources since the textbook, and I'm going to reach out to others.  It seems overwhelming at times but that's how the latter always looks when you're at the very first rung.
